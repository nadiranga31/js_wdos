            <h2>Sri Lanka Turtle Population</h2>
                <p>Today there are 250 species of turtles on earth. Seven of these live in the ocean and are called sea turtles. The remaining 243 species live on land or in freshwater ponds and marshes. The terrestrial turtles, those that live solely on land, are called tortoises.
                <br><br>

                Five of the seven species of sea turtles in the world visit the shores of Sri Lanka to breed. They are the Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas), Hawksbill Turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata), Olive Ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta) and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea). The sea turtles are called Kesbawa in Sinhala and Amai in Tamil.

            <h2>Introduction of the Sri Lankan turtle Hatcheries</h2>
                <p>
                    A turtle hatchery is a facility or a designated area where turtle eggs are collected from their natural nesting sites and incubated in a controlled environment until they hatch. The primary purpose of a turtle hatchery is to protect turtle populations and ensure their survival by providing a safe and suitable environment for the eggs to develop and the hatchlings to emerge.

                    Turtles, particularly sea turtles, face numerous threats in the wild, such as predation, habitat destruction, pollution, and poaching. To counteract these threats, turtle hatcheries are established in various coastal regions around the world, especially in areas where sea turtles regularly nest.
                </p> 
                <br>
                   <h4>The process of operating a turtle hatchery typically involves the following steps:</h4> 
                   <br> 
                   <!--	a bullet point list -->
                    <li>Nesting site identification: Experts or local conservationists locate turtle nesting sites and monitor the nesting activity.

                    </li> 
                    <br>
                    <li>Egg collection: Once a turtle lays its eggs, the eggs are carefully collected from the nest to prevent any damage.
                    </li>
                    <br> 
                    <li> Incubation: The collected eggs are transported to the hatchery, where they are placed in specially designed incubation chambers or nests. These chambers mimic the natural nest conditions, including temperature and humidity, to promote successful development.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Protection and monitoring: The hatchery staff protects the eggs from predators, extreme weather conditions, and human disturbance. Regular monitoring ensures the eggs' progress is tracked, and any potential issues can be addressed promptly.
                    </li> 
                    <br>
                    <li> Hatchling release: When the eggs hatch, the baby turtles, known as hatchlings, are carefully released into the sea. This process often involves releasing them at night to minimize exposure to predators.
                    </li>    
                    <br>
                    
                <p>Turtle hatcheries play a vital role in conserving turtle populations by increasing the survival rate of hatchlings, which face numerous risks during their journey from the nest to the ocean. In some cases, hatcheries also conduct research, educational programs, and public awareness campaigns to promote turtle conservation and raise awareness about the importance of protecting these fascinating creatures and their habitats.
