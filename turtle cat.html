                <p>In Sri Lanka, there are five species of turtles that are commonly found. These species belong to two families: Cheloniidae, which includes the hawksbill turtle and green turtle, and Dermochelyidae, which includes the leatherback turtle.
                
                It's worth mentioning that all five of these turtle species are classified as endangered or critically endangered due to threats such as habitat loss, poaching, and pollution. Efforts are being made in Sri Lanka and globally to protect and conserve these remarkable creatures.

                Green Turtle (Chelonia mydas): The green turtle is one of the most common species found in Sri Lanka. It has a greenish coloration and is known for its herbivorous diet, mainly feeding on seagrasses and algae.
                <br><br>
                The Green turtle  is the  one of the largest known sea turtles. It can be recognized from its flattened body covered by a tear shaped shell that is blackish grey in colour, a smaller head than the loggerhead turtle and a pair of large paddle like flippers. The adult turtle is relatively large weighing between 68 and 190 kg with exceptional species weighing as much as 315 kg. It gets its name from the green colour fat found in the layers under its shell. They are found mainly thriving in the tropical waters of the ocean, feeding only on marine vegetation such as algae and sea grass, returning to the shore to lay eggs.

            <div class="li_left">
               
                <li class="response"> Size: Adult Green Turtles can grow up to 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 meters) in length and weigh around 300 to 500 pounds (136 to 227 kilograms), although some individuals have been recorded to reach even larger sizes.

                </li>
                <li>Importance: Green Turtles play a significant role in marine ecosystems by maintaining the health of seagrass beds and coral reefs. They also serve as indicators of the overall health of marine environments. Additionally, Green Turtles are of cultural and economic importance in many coastal communities, attracting ecotourism and providing livelihoods.</li>

                <li>Life Cycle: Green Turtles reach sexual maturity between 20 and 50 years of age. They have a unique nesting behavior where females return to the beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. They dig a nest in the sand and lay around 100 to 200 eggs, which incubate for about 60 days. After hatching, the baby turtles make their way to the sea, facing numerous threats along the journey.</li>

        The Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) is a marine turtle that is listed as critically endangered by the World Conservation Union as a result of poachers seeking its beautiful ‘tortoise-shell’, which is commercially valuable, human consumption of tortoise flesh & eggs in addition to the reptile getting wedged in fishing gear. 
        <br><br>
        In appearance it is dark golden brown in colour with reddish orange streaks, its most distinctive feature being the thick scutes that make up its hard upper shell. The Hawksbill turtle is relatively small to medium in size with an elongated head that tapers into a pointed hawk-like beak. Its habitat is mainly coral reefs and shallow lagoons where it feeds on sponges, fish, sea anemones and jellyfish amongst others.

    <div class="li_left">
        <li> Size: Adult Hawksbill Turtles typically measure around 2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 centimeters) in length and weigh between 100 to 150 pounds (45 to 68 kilograms). However, some individuals have been known to reach up to 4 feet (120 centimeters) in length.

        </li>
        <li>Importance: Hawksbill Turtles play a crucial role in maintaining the health of coral reef ecosystems. By feeding on sponges, they prevent the sponges from overgrowing and dominating the reef, allowing other species to thrive. They also contribute to beach nutrient cycles through the nesting process, and their presence in the ocean helps maintain the balance of marine ecosystems.</li>

        <li>Habitat: Hawksbill Turtles are found in warm tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They inhabit coral reefs, rocky coastlines, lagoons, and shallow coastal areas. They are known to migrate long distances between nesting and foraging grounds.</li>

        The Loggerhead Sea turtle (Caretta caretta) is reddish brown in colour with a slightly heart shaped top shell and relatively large head. The adult length is approximately three feet with an adult weighing around 250 pounds (113 kg).
        <br><br>
        These marine reptiles are found mostly in salt water sometimes hundreds of miles out in the ocean and also in estuarine habitats such as bays, lagoons and salt marshes with females coming ashore momentarily for nesting. Being carnivores it feeds mainly on marine invertebrates, especially hard shelled crustaceans, which it devours with its powerful jaws. It is believed that the Loggerhead Sea turtle’s lifespan is approximately 50 years.
        <br><br>
        Loggerhead Turtles are an iconic and important species in marine ecosystems. Their conservation is crucial for maintaining the health of ocean ecosystems and preserving the biodiversity of our planet.

        <li>Life Cycle: Loggerhead Turtles have a long lifespan, with some individuals living up to 50 years or more. They reach sexual maturity between 20 and 30 years of age. Nesting occurs on sandy beaches, where the female digs a nest and lays her eggs. The eggs incubate for around 60 days, and then the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the sea.

        </li>
        <li>Habitat: These turtles are found in warm and temperate waters of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. They have a wide distribution and can be found in coastal regions, bays, estuaries, and open ocean areas.</li>

        <li>Migration: Loggerhead Turtles are known for their extensive migration patterns. After nesting, females return to their feeding grounds, which can be hundreds or even thousands of miles away. They navigate using Earth's magnetic field and other cues to find their way back to specific foraging areas.</li>

        The Olive Ridley Sea turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) is found existing in the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. It is relatively small in size with a black heart shaped upper exoskeleton that turns olive green in adulthood. It averages 60-70 centimeters in length, with a weight not exceeding 50kg.
        <br><br>
        
        The Olive Ridley, known to be the sea turtle found most abundantly comes ashore in a unique phenomenon known as “arribada” where large groups of females come all at once to nest. The Olive Ridley feeds mainly on jellyfish, shrimp, mollusks and fish and has an average lifespan of 50 years.

    <div class="li_left">
        <li>Appearance: Olive Ridley turtles have a distinctive olive-colored carapace (shell) that is heart-shaped and relatively broad. They have a smaller head compared to other sea turtle species, with a pair of large, round eyes.

        </li>
        <li>Nesting Behavior: Olive Ridley turtles are well-known for their synchronized mass nesting, known as arribadas. During an arribada, hundreds to thousands of female turtles come ashore simultaneously to lay their eggs on sandy beaches. This phenomenon usually occurs at specific nesting sites.</li>

        <li>Diet: Their diet primarily consists of a variety of marine invertebrates, such as jellyfish, snails, crabs, and shrimp. They are also known to feed on seaweed and algae.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="li_left">
        <li>Adaptations: Leatherback turtles possess unique adaptations that enable them to survive in their environment. Their streamlined body and large front flippers make them highly efficient swimmers, capable of reaching impressive speeds. They also have a specialized heat-conserving structure called a "countercurrent heat exchanger," which allows them to regulate their body temperature even in cold waters.

        </li>
        <li>Nesting Behavior: Leatherback turtles exhibit an impressive nesting behavior. Females return to the same beaches where they were born to lay their eggs. They dig deep nests in the sand and deposit around 80 to 120 eggs, which they then cover before returning to the ocean. The incubation period lasts around 60 to 70 days, after which the hatchlings emerge and make their way to the sea.</li>

        <li>Diet: Leatherback turtles have a diet primarily consisting of jellyfish, but they also consume other soft-bodied marine organisms such as salps, tunicates, and sea squirts. Their esophagus has backward-pointing spines that help them catch and swallow slippery prey.</li>
